# Ghana Precipitation Analysis
# Project Description
This project analyzes and visualizes precipitation data for Ghana from 2001 to 2010. The dataset used is sourced from the Africa Climate Data (CRU) and contains daily precipitation values. 
The goal is to visualize annual precipitation patterns and identify areas where precipitation exceeds 250 mm. 
This project is part for Atmospheric Field Work (MET 359) under the Meteorology and Climate Science degree

# Objectives
1. Data Analysis: Analyze daily precipitation data to compute annual totals and identify trends over the specified period.
2. Visualization: Create informative visualizations to illustrate precipitation patterns across Ghana, highlighting areas with significant rainfall and extreme weather events.
3. Threshold Analysis: Identify and quantify instances where precipitation exceeds 250 mm, which can be critical for understanding flood risks and agricultural planning.
   
# Methodology
1. Data Acquisition: The project utilizes the Africa Climate Data (CRU) dataset, which provides comprehensive precipitation data for the African continent.
2. Data Processing: Using Python libraries such as Xarray and Pandas, the data is filtered for the region of Ghana and the specified time range.
3. Visualization: Matplotlib and Cartopy are employed to create maps that visually represent annual precipitation and highlight areas of interest
